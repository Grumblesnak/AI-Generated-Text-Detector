"Cosmology is the study of the universe, or cosmos, regarded as a whole. Attempting to cover the study of the entire universe in a single volume may seem like a megalomaniac’s dream. The universe, after all, is richly textured, with structures on a vast range of scales; planets orbit stars, stars are collected into galaxies, galaxies are gravitationally bound into clusters, and even clusters of galaxies are found within larger superclusters. Given the richness and complexity of the universe, the only way to condense its history into a single book is by a process of ruthless simplification. For much of this book, therefore, we will be considering the properties of an idealized, perfectly smooth, model universe. Only near the end of the book will we consider how relatively small objects, such as galaxies, clusters, and superclusters, are formed as the universe evolves. It is amusing to note, in this context, that the words “cosmology” and “cosmetology” come from the same Greek root: the word “kosmos”, meaning harmony or order. Just as cosmetologists try to make a human face more harmonious by smoothing over small blemishes such as pimples and wrinkles, cosmologists sometimes must smooth over small “blemishes” such as galaxies.",0,2,2,1,9,8,9,9
"Cosmology is the scientific discipline that investigates the origin, evolution, structure, and ultimate fate of the universe as a whole. It addresses profound questions about the nature of space, time, matter, and energy on the largest scales. At its core, cosmology seeks to understand the overall structure and dynamics of the universe, from the distribution of galaxies and cosmic structures to the cosmic microwave background radiation leftover from the early universe. Key theoretical frameworks include the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense state and has been expanding ever since, and the concept of dark matter and dark energy, which together constitute the majority of the universe's mass-energy content. Observational tools like telescopes, satellites, and experiments, along with sophisticated theoretical models, enable cosmologists to probe the universe's history and unravel its mysteries, providing insights into the fundamental principles governing the cosmos.",1,2,2,3,6,6,7,6
"Dark matter, constituting approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, is an elusive and invisible cosmic ingredient that defies direct observation through electromagnetic radiation. This mysterious substance, distinct from conventional matter, exerts gravitational influence on galaxies and cosmic structures, shaping the large-scale architecture of the cosmos. Despite its pervasive role in the universe's dynamics, dark matter remains undetected by traditional telescopes and instruments, interacting solely through gravity. The need for dark matter arises from its crucial contributions to explaining phenomena such as galaxy rotation curves and the gravitational lensing of light. This abstract delves into the current state of knowledge regarding dark matter, exploring its gravitational effects, the ongoing quest for direct detection, and the persistent challenges in unraveling its fundamental nature. As a fundamental cosmic puzzle, dark matter continues to captivate the scientific community, driving innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks to decipher its enigmatic properties and illuminate its significance in the cosmic narrative.",1,2,2,3,6,6,8,6
"It is embarrassing that 95% of the universe is unaccounted for. Galaxies and larger-scale cosmic structures are composed mainly of ‘dark matter’ whose nature is still unknown. Favoured candidates are weaklyinteracting particles that have survived from the very early universe, but more exotic options cannot be excluded. (There are strong arguments that the dark matter is not composed of baryons). Intensive experimental searches are being made for the ‘dark’ particles (which pervade our entire galaxy), but we have indirect clues to their nature too. Inferences from galactic dynamics and gravitational lensing allow astronomers to ‘map’ the dark matter distribution; comparison with numerical simulations of galaxy formation can constrain (eg) the particle velocities and collision cross sections. And, of course, progress in understanding the extreme physics of the ultra-early universe could offer clues to what particle might have existed then, and how many would have survived. The mean cosmic density of dark matter (plus baryons) is now pinned down to be only about 30% of the so-called critical density corresponding to a ‘flat’ universe. However, other recent evidence – microwave background anisotropies, complemented by data on distant supernovae – reveals that our universe actually is ‘flat’, but that its dominant ingredient (about 70% of the total mass-energy) is something quite unexpected — ‘dark energy’ pervading all space, with negative pressure. We now confront two mysteries: (i) Why does the universe have three quite distinct basic ingredients – baryons, dark matter and dark energy – in the proportions (roughly) 5%, 25% and 70%? (ii) What are the (almost certainly profound) implications of the ‘dark energy’ for fundamental physics?",0,2,2,3,9,8,9,9
