"Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the oldest field of computer science and very broad, dealing with all aspects of mimicking cognitive functions for real-world problem solving and building systems that learn and think like people. Therefore, it is
often called machine intelligence (Poole, Mackworth, & Goebel, 1998) to contrast it to human intelligence (Russell & Norvig,
2010). The field revolved around the intersection of cognitive science and computer science (Tenenbaum, Kemp, Griffiths, &
Goodman, 2011). AI now raises enormous interest due to the practical successes in machine learning (ML). In AI there was
always a strong linkage to explainability, and an early example is the Advice Taker proposed by McCarthy in 1958 as a “program with common sense” (McCarthy, 1960). It was probably the first time proposing common sense reasoning abilities as
the key to AI. Recent research emphasizes more and more that AI systems should be able to build causal models of the world
that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems (Lake, Ullman, Tenenbaum, & Gershman, 2017).",0,0,0

"In the 21st century artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important area of research in virtually all fields: engineering, science, education, medicine, business, accounting, finance, marketing, economics, stock market and law, among others (Halal (2003), Masnikosa (1998), Metaxiotis et al. (2003), Raynor (2000), Stefanuk and Zhozhikashvili (2002), Tay and Ho (1992) and Wongpinunwatana et al. (2000)). The field of AI has grown enormously to the extent that tracking proliferation of studies becomes a difficult task (Ambite and Knoblock (2001), Balazinski et al. (2002), Cristani (1999) and Goyache (2003)). Apart from the application of AI to the fields mentioned above, studies have been segregated into many areas with each of these springing up as individual fields of knowledge (Eiter et al.

"In recent years, networking and collaboration have become increasingly popular in education. Local and national initiatives have stimulated a variety of cooperative arrangements, from groups of schools that have volunteered to work together, to groups that have been induced to do so in the context of incentives, to others that have been subject to direct external pressure to collaborate (West & Ainscow, 2006). These many initiatives have not typically been based on a clear understanding and definition of what is meant by networking in education, however. One of the few definitions found in education was coined by Hadfield, Jopling, Noden, O’Leary, and Stoll (2006) on behalf of the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) in England. A network is defined by them as: ‘‘groups or systems of interconnected people and organisations (including schools) whose aims and purposes include the improvement of learning and aspects of well-being known to affect learning’’ (Hadfield et al., 2006, p. 5). This, however, is both an overly broad definition of networking when one is discussing networking at the organisational level, and an overly prescriptive one. On the one hand, it appears to encompass networks of individuals, possibly even within schools, while, on the other hand, it is highly prescriptive in its insistence on one particular goal that would describe all network activity. As we will see below, fruitful forms of interschool networking do not always revolve around pupil learning.",0,0,0
"THE REDUCTION of energy consumption has become
a key issue for industries, because of economical, environmental and marketing reasons. If this concern has a
strong influence on electronics designers, the information and
communication technology sector, and more specifically the
networking field, is also concerned. For instance, data-centers
and networking infrastructure involve high-performance and
high-availability machines. They therefore rely on powerful
devices, which require energy-consuming air conditioning to
sustain their operation, and which are organized in a redundant
architecture. As these architectures are often designed to
endure peak load and degraded conditions, they are underutilized in normal operation, leaving a large room for energy
savings. In recent years, valuable efforts have indeed been
dedicated to reducing unnecessary energy expenditure, which
is usually nicknamed as a greening of the networking technologies and protocols.",0,1,0
"The systematic review from which the findings in this paper are presented is motivated
by a quest to establish the extent to which UK
companies are engaged in networking activities when seeking to develop their innovative
capacity. Specifically, the objectives of the review
are to:
(1) establish the nature of the relationship
between networking and innovation
(2) compare the degree and impact of networking behaviour in the UK with that of
businesses in competing countries
(3) explore examples and literature on the failure of business-to-business networks
(4) generate insights informing policies aimed
at fostering business-to-business networking
leading to greater innovative capacity and
(5) identify areas for future research for the
Economic and Social Research Council’s
(ESRC) research priorities board.
The Porter Report (Porter and Ketels 2003)
establishes that inter-organizational networking is critical for the development of innovative ability in firms. The extent to which UK
firms are involved in networking and how this
activity translates into innovative outcomes is,
however, less clear in the report. For instance,
Porter’s study concludes that the UK underperforms key competitors in this area but provides little in the way of evidence to justify

"Over the last two decades, noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been the subject of extensive research in the frame of nanotechnology, mainly owing to their unique optical properties. Indeed, the free electron gas of such NPs features a resonant oscillation upon illumination in the visible part of the spectrum. The spectral properties of this resonance depend on the constitutive material, the geometry of the NP and its environment. This resonant electronic oscillation is called localized surface plasmon (LSP), and the field of research that studies the fundamentals and applications of LSP is known as nanoplasmonics.1 LSPs are accompanied by valuable physical effects such as optical near-field enhancement, heat generation and excitation of hot-electrons. Hence, plasmonic NPs can behave as efficient nanosources of heat, light or energetic electrons, remotely controllable by light. In nanoplasmonics, these properties have stimulated extensive basic research and already led to a wide range of applications in nanotechnologies.
Light and heat are physical quantities involved in many mechanisms in physics, chemistry and biology. Hence, a natural trend is to explore possible frameworks that could gain from the unique properties of metal NPs. So far, biology has been one of the areas of science that has benefited the most from nanoplasmonics. For instance, gold NPs as nanosources of heat are already at the basis of applications ranging from photothermal cancer therapy,2–4 bio-imaging,5 drug delivery6 and nanosurgery.7 Chemistry is another field of science that can potentially greatly profit from plasmonic NPs. Indeed, heat is a major parameter in any chemical reaction, light can be used to achieve high selectivity in chemical mechanisms thanks to quantum selection rules and adjustable photon energies, and electron transfer is the basis of redox reactions. Hence, the idea to use metal NPs as efficient nanosources of heat, light and electrons appears to be an appealing concept to both boost the yield of chemical reactions and improve their spatial and temporal control.

In this tutorial review, we survey recent advances in plasmon-assisted chemistry. The first section gives the readers the basics of nanoplasmonics. We successively describe the optical and thermal properties of metal NPs as well as the process of hot electron generation. In the second section we review the first class of studies in which the intense light field concentrated at the metal NP surface drives photochemical reactions. The third section focuses on exploiting the heat generated by metal NPs to control the yield of chemical reactions. Finally, the last section discusses how energetic electrons can be extracted from the NP to trigger chemical transformation of neighbouring reactants or enhance the efficiency of photocatalysts.",0,0,0
"Kohn–Sham DFT1–5 has in the recent past emerged as an important first-principles computational method6 – 15 to predict chemical properties accurately16 – 22and to analyze and interpret these in convenient and simple chemical terms.23 – 31 The reasons for its popularity and success are easy to understand. In the first place, the DFT approach is in principle exact. The exact exchangeand-correlation (XC) functional is unknown, but the currently available XC functionals provide in most cases already a “chemical” accuracy of a few kcal/mol for binding energies.16, 22, 32, 33 Moreover, the quest for more accurate ones based on a more detailed understanding of their essential properties is continuing.27, 28, 34 – 46 In the second place, it preserves at all levels of approximation the appealing one-electron molecular orbital (MO) view on chemical reactions and properties. The computed orbitals are suitable for the typical MO-theoretical analyses and interpretations.27, 29 – 31 The KS method effectively incorporates all correlation effects. In the third place, it is a relatively efficient computational method, and its fundamental scaling properties do not deteriorate when methodological precision is increased, in particular, when a more accurate XC functional is applied. Recent research paves the way to implementations that scale only linearly with the system size.15, 47 – 60 This brings within reach the treatment by fundamental quantum chemical methods of systems with hundreds, maybe even thousands of atoms.",0,0,0
"Cyclopropanol and its derivatives are carbocyclic homologues of enols, and there is an obvious similarity in chemical properties between these classes of compounds due to the well-known “unsaturated” character of the cyclopropane ring. Although cyclopropanols are usually less reactive than their olefinic “relatives”, their chemical properties are more diverse than those of enols or enolates. Cyclopropanols are able to undergo synthetically useful transformations with retention or cleavage of the strained three-carbon ring. In the latter case, cyclopropanols act formally as equivalents of homoenolates (C 1?C3 cyclopropane ring cleavage) or corresponding allylic derivatives (C 2?C 3 ring cleavage).
Cyclopropanol was first synthesized in 1942 by Cottle and co-workers.1,2 The development of cyclopropanol chemistry in the past decades has been quite fruitful, and these compounds occupied their own niche in synthetic practice as useful intermediates in organic synthesis 3-11 and as substances which are capable of possessing important kinds of biological activity. 12-16 The present review is written for the purpose of reflecting recent achievements in the areas of synthesis and synthetic applications of cyclopropanols.

"Mesopotamia is known to scholars and laypeople alike as the cradle of civilization. Home to some of the earliest cities in the world, famous for the law codes of its kings and for the invention of writing, the rst home of the biblical Abraham, it has achieved a reputation as the birthplace of many of the hallmarks of Western civilization. Its name comes from a Greek word meaning the “land between the rivers” – the alluvial plains of the Tigris and the Euphrates, including large portions of the modern countries of Iraq and Syria ( g. 1.1). The ancient inhabitants of this region maintained contacts with people living beyond it, including those of the lowlands of southwestern Iran, the valleys of the Zagros Mountains, and the foothills of the Taurus Range. Rome was not built in a day, nor were the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia. We will consider developments that occurred over the course of almost three millennia, from ca. 5000 to 2100 B.C. – in archaeological terminology the Ubaid, Uruk, Jemdet Nasr, Early Dynastic, and Akkadian periods (table 1.1). During these 3,000 years, Mesopotamia developed from a sparsely populated region in which the majority of settlements were small agricultural villages to a land of several hundred thousand people, most of them living in large cities and many engaged in specialized occupations. Architecture became increasingly grandiose and elaborate. An ever-wider array of raw materials was imported to manufacture utilitarian items and luxury goods and to adorn the temples of the gods and the homes of the rich and powerful. Despite this increasing material prosperity,the emergence of civilization was not a uniformly positive development. Along with the construction of impressive city walls and elaborate temples adorned with sculptures and inlaid with semiprecious stones and metals and the elaboration of artistic expression of all kinds came the exploitation of the “common” people. It was the labor of the majority that funded the trading expeditions, military conquests, and artisanal expertise responsible for the great works of art and architecture that we still admire today.",0,0,0
"In mid November 2012, Mongolia celebrated with great pomp the 850th birthday of Chinggis Khan (1162–1227). The celebrations included an international conference entitled “Chinggis Khan and Globalization.” While this was an impressive manifestation of the use of the Mongol Empire for constructing national identity, the conference’s title reflects the fascination of our globalized age with periods of early globalization such as Mongol rule in 13th and 14th century’s Eurasia. Indeed, the study of the Mongol Empire has made enormous strides in the past two decades, and its most notable impact is the shift of seeing the Empire not only in national or regional terms but from a holistic perspective, in its full Eurasian context. This focus, credited mostly to the seminal works of Thomas T. Allsen, also means that the scholarly literature now gives more space to topics that interest world historians such as the cultural, economic and religious exchanges that prevailed in Mongol Eurasia. Simultaneously, the Mongols’ image in the scholarly literature begins to shift from the barbarian warriors obsessed with massacres and plunder, to the Mongols as active promoters of cross-cultural connections, who even brought about the transition from the medieval to the modern world. Part of this new focus was enthusiastically embraced by world history textbooks, although these works often tend to relate to the Mongols more as a passive medium, the main contribution of which was the unification of a vast territory under one rule, and ignore the Mongols’ nomadic culture and its impact.2",0,0,0
"Without doubt, emperors in early modern Japan were impotent and the imperial court in Kyoto survived due to bakufu largesse. The Tokugawa military regime in Edo exercised de facto sovereign power. The shogun, not the emperor, took responsibility for Japan's defense and foreign re- lations; the shogun, not the emperor, conferred lands to daimyo and confiscated these from them. Politically conscious Japanese in early to mid-Tokugawa times believed that the emperor and court had proven their administrative incompetence by the time of Emperor Go-Daigo (r. 1318- 39). People assumed that only military governments could rule effectively in Japan after centuries of court corruption and decline that had culminated in the disastrous Jokyt War of 1221 and Kemmu Restoration of 1333-36. Tokugawa thinkers construed this fall of the imperial house leading to warrior and bakufu supremacy as ""historically irreversible."" "" As the Chu Hsi Confucian Muro Kyuso (1658-1734) noted, it ran contrary to reason in nature and human affairs to desire a never-ending imperial dynasty: ""No dynasty that has risen to power has ever avoided falling from it, [just as] no man given life has ever escaped death."" 2 The Sorai School thinkers, Dazai Shundai (1680-1747) and Yamagata Daini (1725-67), called Japan's im- perial house a ""defunct dynasty"" (shokoku).13 According to Kumazawa Banzan (1611-91), ""control of the realm will never revert to imperial court nobles; for even if we warriors restored it to them, [their rule] would not last for long."" 14 Or, as Yamaga Soko (1622-85) put it, ""even myriad oxen could not return the imperial court to the power it enjoyed in antiquity",0,0,0
"Europa, the second of the four Galilean satellites in its distance from Jupiter, is an ice-covered body with a radius of 1560 km, about the same size as Earth’s Moon (1738 km). Europa is locked in a tidal resonance with its neighboring satellites, volcanic Io on the inside and large Ganymede on the outside. Like each of the Galilean moons, Europa is spin-locked to Jupiter, rotating about its pole with a period identical to its orbital period of 3.6 Earth days. The resonance keeps the satellites from perfect circular orbits, inducing a forced eccentricity that varies their distances from Jupiter and results in tidal flexing and internal dissipation of energy. This heating is most intense at Io, due to its proximity to the giant planet Jupiter, and results in constant volcanic activity on that small moon. A substantial amount of heat is dissipated within Europa’s core, mantle, and ice shell as well (Cassen et al., 1979, 1980; Ojakangas and Stevenson, 1989). Gravity measurements made by the Galileo spacecraft (Anderson et al., 1998) show that Europa is an internally differentiated rocky body with about 100 km of material of density ?1000 kg m?3 at its surface, virtually certainly water in either solid or liquid phase. If this water were predominantly liquid, it would be more than double the volume of all of Earth’s oceans combined. Europa’s surface varies in temperature from about 50 K near the poles to as much as 120 K at the equator (Ojakangas and Stevenson, 1989; Spencer et al., 1999). Its tenuous atmosphere, due mostly to oxygen sputtered from its surface ice (Hall et al., 1995; Sieger et al., 1998), is in fact a near-vacuum. Liquid water exposed at Europa’s surface would rapidly boil and freeze; once freezing progressed to about half a meter the pressure of this ice cap would exceed the vapor pressure of the underlying water and boiling would cease (Reynolds et al., 1983).",0,0,0
"Juno crossed Jupiter’s polar regions on 27 August 2016 and performed the first plasma and wave measurements in the low-altitude auroral regions of Jupiter (see Bagenal et al. [2014], for review of Juno’s magnetospheric objectives). This constitutes the first opportunity to directly investigate in situ the properties of the Jovian auroral radio emissions and measure the features of the electron populations that may be responsible for their generation. Analysis at similar levels of detail was only possible at Earth with spinning spacecraft such as S3-3, Viking, and FAST [Omidi et al., 1984; Roux et al., 1993; Ergun et al., 1998]. The other unique example of extraterrestrial source crossing was at Saturn with Cassini [Lamy et al., 2010]. One objective of this exploration is to understand the scenario for generation of one of the most powerful nonthermal radio emissions in the solar system, well explored since the dawn of radio astronomy [Burke and Franklin, 1955] by professional and amateur observers. Such a scenario is likely of general astrophysical use [Melrose and Dulk, 1982]. It is now widely recognized that the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) is the generation mechanism of the nonthermal auroral radio emissions (see Wu [1985] for a review). A large number of theoretical studies and observations support this mechanism (see Zarka [1998] for a review). The CMI indeed appears to be particularly capable of the amplification of X-mode waves at frequencies close to the electron gyrofrequency in a tenuous plasma (? = (fp/fc) 2 ? 1 where fp and fc are respectively the electron plasma and gyrofrequency) provided that the electron distribution presents positive ?f/?v? gradients (v? is the velocity perpendicular to the static B field). These are very general features of the electron velocity distributions observed in the auroral regions which is why the CMI theory is widely successful.",0,0,0
"The favored model for the formation of the Moon is the “Giant Impact”: during the last stage of terrestrial planet formation, planetary embryos of Moon- to Mars-size (approximately 0.01–0.1 Earth masses, ME) collide in a sequence of massive mutual collisions – called Giant Impacts – until all or most of them have been accreted into a few, large rocky planets (e.g., Weidenschilling, 2000). In the Solar System, two “fully grown” rocky planets – Venus and Earth – formed, while two likely planetary embryos – Mercury and Mars – remained on stranded orbits (e.g., Hansen, 2009). A planetary embryo having between one fourth to two Mars masses (depending on the Giant Impact model; see below), called “Theia” after the mythological mother of the Greek Moon-goddess Selene, then collides with the almost fully formed, differentiated proto-Earth, a few 10 Ma after the formation of the Solar System. Such a Giant Impact can explain the observed physical properties of the Earth–Moon system: the high angular momentum, the iron-deficiency of the bulk Moon and the high mass ratio between the Moon and Earth (Hartmann and Davis, 1975, Cameron and Ward, 1976).",0,0,0
