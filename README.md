# AI-Generated-Text-Detector
Machine learning Python program for detecting AI-generated text V0.5

If you are downloading the main file (for whatever reason) then run it on the latest instance of JetBrains Pycharm Community Edition for simplicities sake as that is what I wrote it on, and also install the required packages when prompted if needed. Couldn't add the other files alongside the main code so may need to create a new project then copy and paste the code into a new main.py file. Attempted to reinstall Pycharm Edu but all links lead to Community Edition instead, seems to work fine though.

Initial 0.5 Build:
  No GUI, 
  Inbuilt text input, 
  Console outputs, 
  Small training dataset.

Update 1.0 Changes:
  Simple GUI, 
  Can exit program from GUI, 
  Text input on GUI, replaces previous inbuilt text input, 
  Outputs on GUI, replaces previous console outputs, 
  Slightly expanded training dataset, 
  (Minor) Renamed some things that used American spelling (z) to British spelling (s).

Planned 1.5 Changes:
  Build training dataset file, 
  Replace current training dataset style with file usage, 
  Expand training dataset more.

Planned 2.0 Changes:
  Allow document upload in GUI and code (txt, word, pdf), 
  Refuse non-valid file uploads (mp3, mp4, etc), 
  Expand training dataset.

Planned 2.5 Changes:
  Allow replacement of base training dataset with custom file upload via GUI, 
  Highlighting analysed text that triggers detection/similarity with AI-generations.
