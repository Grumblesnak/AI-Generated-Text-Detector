# AI-Generated-Text-Detector
Machine learning Python program for detecting AI-generated text V0.5

If you are downloading the main file (for whatever reason) then run it on the latest instance of JetBrains Pycharm Community Edition for simplicities sake as that is what I wrote it on, and also install the required packages when prompted if needed. Couldn't add the other files alongside the main code so may need to create a new project then copy and paste the code into a new main.py file. Attempted to reinstall Pycharm Edu but all links lead to Community Edition instead, seems to work fine though.

Updates from previous model:
